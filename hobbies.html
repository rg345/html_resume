    </li>
    <li>Photography
        <P>I am just an occasional photographer who can astonish people with my photos at some odd times >.<.</P>
    </li>
    <li>Storytelling(if that counts ^-^)
        <p>I have been fascinated by stories since my childhood ranging back to some of my most earlier classes probably class 2 or 3.I was one of the guys who would end up reading all the stories available in the Hindi and English textbooks and thinking of a my own version of them,I found atmost happiness in creating varied characters and then thinking about their characters, their appearences,their speaking style etc.</p>

    </li>
    <li>Music</li>
    <ul>
    <p>When my life throws some unexpected problems on me,like a climber climbing a hill facing the stones coming with full speed towards him then it's the music which is still holding me up.Also am a very moody listener and vice versa too,songs can change my mind from a sad one to something cheerful bumping with joy for no reason >.< </p>
    </ul>
